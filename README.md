# CoffeeShop E-Commerce Website

Welcome to the CoffeeShop E-Commerce Website, a sample React application showcasing a frontend for a virtual coffee shop. This project is built entirely with React, utilizing modern tools and libraries like Tailwind CSS, HeadlessUI, Typescript, and Vite for efficient development. The data for products and user cart items are stored in the browser's Local Storage for a simplified, client-only experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be accessible and responsive across various devices, providing a seamless experience for users on both desktop and mobile.

- **Product Catalog**: Browse through a variety of coffee products with detailed descriptions, prices, and images. Products and their details are stored in Local Storage.

- **Shopping Cart**: Manage your selected items in the shopping cart. Users can add, remove, and update quantities of products, and all changes are stored in Local Storage.

- **Checkout Process**: A simplified checkout process allows users to enter their shipping information and complete the purchase. For the sake of this sample, no actual payment processing is implemented.

- **User Authentication**: Implement Google Login for user authentication. This provides a secure and convenient way for users to create accounts and log in.

- **Map Integration**: Utilize Mapbox to display the location of the coffee shop, providing users with a visual reference.
